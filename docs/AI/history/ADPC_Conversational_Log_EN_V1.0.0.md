## Session V1.0.0 — 2026-09-27 → 2026-09-29

### Context

Multi-project maintenance session run from the `I_Offertator_V1` VS Code workspace (19 projects). The Mac moved from Node 25 to **Node 24 LTS** (nvm). Rules followed: never `npm audit fix` (fix by updating versions or targeted `overrides`), only same-major updates, Docker untouched, no PHP installed on the Mac, `crypto-js` kept on purpose.

**Summary for this project:** `composer serve` hardened (4 workers, memory and time limits); AI docs and README updated.

### User Requests

1. Apply the hardened `composer serve` script to every Slim/PHP project that uses `php -S` (not to Laravel).
2. Update the AI docs and READMEs of every modified project (conversational log EN + ES, new version per session).

### Assistant Actions

#### `composer serve`

- `composer serve` (built-in `php -S`) was measured inside the Slim container: memory stable at ~57 MB after 1,600+ requests (no leak) and request errors never kill the server. The risks were that `php -S` uses the CLI `php.ini` (`memory_limit = -1`, `max_execution_time = 0`) and a single worker, so one slow request blocked all the others (2.7 s wait vs 15 ms with 4 workers).
- The `serve` script in `composer.json` now reads:

```json
"serve": [
    "Composer\\Config::disableProcessTimeout",
    "@putenv PHP_CLI_SERVER_WORKERS=4",
    "@php -d memory_limit=256M -d max_execution_time=60 -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t public/"
]
```
- Verified with a real `composer serve` in the container: 1 master + 4 workers, and inside a request PHP reports `memory_limit=256M`, `max_execution_time=60`, `PHP_CLI_SERVER_WORKERS=4` (Composer's own `-d memory_limit=-1` is overridden because ours comes later). An infinite loop is cut at the limit without killing the server. `composer.lock` is not affected (scripts are not part of its hash).

### Verification
